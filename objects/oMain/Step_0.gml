// Don't do anything if a menu is open. We don't need to check for the pause menu because
// the ball should not be moving anyway

// If there are no balls left...

	// Lose a life.

	// If there are no lives left you lose

	// But if there are lives left...


		// Create a new ball!

		
		// And play a sound


// Count ALL bricks.


// If no destroyable blocks remain, you win!


		// If it's the final level we don't spawn the next button sequence
